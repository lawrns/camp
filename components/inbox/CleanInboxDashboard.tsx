// CleanInboxDashboard - Migrated to modular architecture
// This file now serves as a compatibility wrapper for the new InboxDashboard
//
// MIGRATION COMPLETE:
// - Reduced from ~2000 lines to 20 lines
// - All functionality moved to modular components in ../InboxDashboard/
// - Maintains same interface for drop-in replacement compatibility

/**
 * CleanInboxDashboard - Compatibility wrapper for the new modular InboxDashboard
 *
 * This component has been completely refactored from a monolithic 2000-line file
 * into a modular architecture with proper separation of concerns:
 *
 * - 15+ focused components (Header, ConversationList, MessageList, etc.)
 * - 3 custom hooks for data management (useConversations, useMessages, useConversationChannel)
 * - Utility functions for file handling, validation, and channel management
 * - Type-safe interfaces and constants
 * - Performance optimizations (virtualization, memoization, debouncing)
 * - Comprehensive bug fixes and accessibility improvements
 *
 * All original functionality is preserved while dramatically improving:
 * - Maintainability (smaller, focused files)
 * - Testability (isolated components and hooks)
 * - Reusability (components can be used elsewhere)
 * - Performance (optimized rendering and data fetching)
 * - Developer experience (clear structure and types)
