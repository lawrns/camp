// OrganizationSettings - Migrated to modular architecture
// This file now serves as a compatibility wrapper for the new organization settings system
//
// MIGRATION COMPLETE:
// - Reduced from ~840 lines to ~20 lines
// - All functionality moved to modular components in ./organization-settings/
// - Maintains same interface for drop-in replacement compatibility

/**
 * OrganizationSettings - Compatibility wrapper for the new modular system
 *
 * This component has been completely refactored from a monolithic 840-line file
 * into a modular architecture with proper separation of concerns:
 *
 * - Multiple focused components (GeneralSettingsForm, MemberManagement, etc.)
 * - Type-safe interfaces and configuration objects
 * - Reusable form components and validation
 * - Comprehensive settings management
 *
 * All original functionality is preserved while dramatically improving:
 * - Maintainability (smaller, focused files)
 * - Testability (isolated components and hooks)
 * - Reusability (components can be used elsewhere)
 * - Performance (optimized form handling and validation)
 * - Developer experience (clear structure and types)
