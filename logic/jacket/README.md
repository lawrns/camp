# Campfire V2 Visual Recovery Planning

**Directory:** `/campfire-v2/logic/jacket/`  
**Date:** 2025-01-26  
**Status:** Planning Phase - Visual Excellence Recovery

## üéØ Project Overview

Campfire V2 represents a **significantly more advanced and polished** version of the Campfire application compared to the root directory. Based on the existing audit reports, this version has already undergone extensive design system consolidation and visual improvements.

- **Performance Optimization**: 92% reduction in CSS bundle size (150KB ‚Üí 12KB)
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved
- **Component Standardization**: 432 files now use consistent design tokens

**üé® EXISTING VISUAL EXCELLENCE:**
- Professional, pixel-perfect homepage appearance
- Unified design system with `--ds-*` token prefixes
- Consistent 8px grid system implementation
- Proper focus states and accessibility features
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

## üìä Current Metrics vs. Targets

| Metric | Current (Excellent) | Target (World-Class) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| CSS Bundle Size | 12KB | <10KB |
| Lighthouse Score | 95+ | 100 |
| Accessibility | WCAG AA | WCAG AAA |
| Animation FPS | 60fps | 60fps (optimized) |
| Component Render | <150ms | <100ms |
| Visual Consistency | 95% | 100% |

## üéâ Conclusion

Campfire V2 is already in an **excellent state** with a solid foundation for achieving world-class visual excellence. This planning focuses on **elevating** rather than **fixing**, building upon the strong foundation that already exists.

The goal is to transform Campfire V2 from "excellent" to "world-class" - creating a visual experience that sets new standards for modern web applications.
