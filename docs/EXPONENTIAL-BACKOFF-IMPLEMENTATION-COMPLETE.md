## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **1. Exponential Backoff Algorithm**
```typescript
// Progressive timeouts: 15s ‚Üí 30s ‚Üí 60s
const timeouts = [15000, 30000, 60000];
const currentTimeout = timeouts[attempt - 1] || timeouts[timeouts.length - 1];
```

### **2. Retry Logic with Delays**
```typescript
// Different delays based on error type:
// - Timeout errors: 1s, 2s delay between retries
// - Channel errors: 2s, 4s delay (longer for channel issues)
// - Connection issues: 1.5s, 3s delay (medium delay)
```

### **3. Comprehensive Error Handling**
```typescript
switch (status) {
  case 'SUBSCRIBED': // Success - resolve immediately
  case 'CHANNEL_ERROR': // Retry with longer delay
  case 'TIMED_OUT': // Retry with medium delay  
  case 'CLOSED': // Retry with medium delay
  default: // Continue waiting
}
```

### **4. Enhanced Monitoring and Logging**
```typescript
console.log(`[Realtime] ‚è±Ô∏è Using timeout: ${currentTimeout / 1000}s (exponential backoff)`);
console.log(`[Realtime] ‚úÖ Successfully subscribed to ${channelName} on attempt ${attempt} after ${elapsed}ms`);
```
