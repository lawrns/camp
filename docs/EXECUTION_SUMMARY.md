## Execution Summary â€” Supabase Consolidation & Dev Health

Date: (auto)

### Completed
- Single Supabase factory: `lib/supabase/index.ts` with `supabase.browser()`, `supabase.server(cookies)`, `supabase.admin()`.
- Replaced deprecated helpers and removed `@/lib/supabase/consolidated-exports` imports across app/components/lib/src.
- Fixed SSR await chunk error by switching to `require('next/headers')` in server path for `getClient()`.
- Gated OpenAI client in `lib/ai/core.ts` when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing.
- Lucide icon import fixes in knowledge editor.
- `middleware.ts` kept on `@supabase/ssr` with cookie handling cleanups.
- Dev server starts cleanly on port 3001; dashboard and APIs respond 200.

### Outstanding (High Priority)
- Phase 2: Design System Implementation
  - Normalize components to `components/ui/*` (replace `unified-ui`), ensure variants/tokens/wrappers.
  - Responsive/overflow fixes at 320/375/768/1024/1440.
  - Standardized empty/loading and a11y patterns.
  - Refactor pages: team, analytics, integrations, notifications, help.
  - New scaffold: `/dashboard/settings` (added basic page).
- Phase 3: API-Based E2E Testing
  - Run full cross-browser E2E with storageState; add stable snapshots.
- Phase 4: Logic-UI Integration
  - Wire missing handlers, optimistic updates; add error/loading; verify a11y.

### Known Issues / Notes
- Repo-wide lint errors exist in unrelated modules (telemetry, utils, tests). Triage and fix in scoped PRs.
- Supabase warnings: prefer `auth.getUser()` vs `getSession()` where authentication is security-sensitive.

### Next Steps
1) Implement Phase 2 on one representative page to land patterns, then sweep.
2) Run comprehensive E2E and triage failures.
3) Wire remaining handlers and a11y.
