# TODO.md - Campfire V2 Implementation Progress

## Current Task
- [x] CRITICAL NAMING CONVENTION FIXES - COMPLETED

## Completed  
- [x] Read and analyzed THEPLAN.md
- [x] Phase 1, Day 1-2: Route Structure & Navigation
  - [x] Created missing page files (knowledge, team, integrations, notifications, help, profile)
  - [x] Implemented basic page layouts with error boundaries
  - [x] Fixed navigation 404 errors
- [x] Phase 1, Day 3-4: Basic API Endpoints
  - [x] Implemented conversations API (/api/conversations)
  - [x] Implemented tickets API (/api/tickets and /api/tickets/[id])
  - [x] Implemented organization settings API (/api/organizations/[id]/settings)
  - [x] Implemented widget messages API (/api/widget/messages)
  - [x] Implemented analytics dashboard API (/api/analytics/dashboard)
- [x] CRITICAL NAMING CONVENTION FIXES
  - [x] Fixed API field names to match database schema (camelCase)
  - [x] Fixed database queries to use correct field names
  - [x] Standardized API responses to return direct data
  - [x] Deleted competing real-time system (ConnectionManager.ts)
  - [x] Aligned all API endpoints with established patterns

## Issues Identified & Lessons Learned
- ❌ Created competing real-time systems instead of using existing standardized-realtime.ts
- ❌ Didn't follow established patterns in API implementation
- ❌ No database schema foundation - implemented APIs without proper data structure
- ❌ Fragmented architecture approach violated single source of truth principle

## Corrected Approach - Single Source of Truth
- ✅ Use existing standardized-realtime.ts as single real-time system
- ✅ Follow established API patterns and authentication flows
- ✅ Database-first approach - create schema before implementing APIs
- ✅ Fix existing systems instead of creating new ones
- ✅ Maintain consistent naming and architecture patterns

## Critical Fixes Applied
- ✅ Fixed all API field names: organization_id → organizationId, customer_email → customerEmail, etc.
- ✅ Fixed all database queries: .eq('organization_id') → .eq('organizationId')
- ✅ Standardized API responses: { conversations } → conversations
- ✅ Removed competing real-time system
- ✅ Aligned with database schema camelCase conventions

## Next Steps
- [ ] Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
  - [ ] Day 1-2: Route Structure & Navigation
  - [ ] Day 2-3: Authentication & Context (Already completed)
  - [ ] Day 3-4: Basic API Endpoints
- [ ] Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)
  - [ ] Day 5-7: Real-time System
  - [ ] Day 8-10: Widget System
  - [ ] Day 11-12: Analytics Pipeline
- [ ] Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (Week 3)
  - [ ] Day 13-14: Testing & Quality Assurance
  - [ ] Day 15-17: Performance Optimization
  - [ ] Day 18-19: Documentation & Deployment

## Priority Order
1. Create missing page files (Critical - 404 errors)
2. Implement API endpoints (High - functionality broken)
3. Fix real-time system (Critical - chat broken)
4. Complete widget system (High - messaging broken)
5. Analytics pipeline (Medium - data missing)
6. Testing and optimization (High - quality assurance)
