# Supabase Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report details the security improvements made to the Supabase database permissions and Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the Campfire application.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Overly Permissive GRANT ALL Statements

**Issue**: The original migrations used `GRANT ALL` on critical tables, giving the service role unnecessary permissions including `TRUNCATE`, `REFERENCES`, and `TRIGGER`.

**Fix**: Replaced with specific grants using the principle of least privilege:

- Core tables: `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`
- Payment tables: `SELECT, INSERT` only (no UPDATE/DELETE for audit trail)
- Read-only tables: `SELECT` only

### 2. Weak RLS Policies Using USING (true)

**Issue**: Multiple tables had RLS policies with `USING (true)`, allowing unrestricted access to all rows.

**Tables Affected**:

- conversations
- messages
- typing_indicators
- widget_welcome_config
- widget_quick_replies
- faq_categories

**Fix**: Implemented organization-level data isolation:

- All policies now check organization membership
- User access is restricted to their organization's data
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations

### 3. Missing Organization Context Validation

**Issue**: No validation that operations are performed within the correct organizational context.

**Fix**: Created helper functions:

- `user_has_organization_access()`: Validates user membership and roles
- `validate_organization_context()`: Ensures organization exists and user has access
- `get_user_organizations()`: Returns user's active organizations

### 4. Service Role Permissions

**Issue**: Service role had blanket access without any validation.

**Fix**:

- Service role maintains necessary access for API operations
- Added WITH CHECK clauses to ensure required fields are set
- Prevents creation of orphaned records

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Organization-Level Data Isolation

All RLS policies now enforce strict organization boundaries:

```sql
-- Example: Users can only see conversations in their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users access conversations in their organizations"
ON public.conversations FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
    organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id
        FROM public.organization_members
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND status = 'active'
    )
);
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control

Different permission levels based on user roles:

- **Owners**: Full access to organization data including payments
- **Admins**: Management access excluding financial data
- **Agents**: Access to assigned conversations and general data
- **Members**: Read-only access to organization data

### 3. Audit Trail Protection

Payment records cannot be updated or deleted, ensuring audit trail integrity:

```sql
-- Service role can only read and insert payments
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON public.payments TO service_role;
-- No UPDATE or DELETE permissions granted
```

### 4. Security Audit Logging

Added optional RLS audit logging to track policy violations:

- Logs failed access attempts
- Records user, operation, and timestamp
- Only accessible to service role and organization admins

## Migration Files Created

1. **20250701000001_secure_service_role_permissions.sql**
   - Implements principle of least privilege
   - Creates secure RLS policies with organization isolation
   - Adds helper functions for access control

2. **20250701000002_fix_weak_rls_policies.sql**
   - Fixes all `USING (true)` policies
   - Adds proper context validation
   - Creates audit logging infrastructure

3. **20250701000003_test_service_permissions.sql**
   - Comprehensive test suite for permissions
   - Verifies service operations still work
   - Validates RLS policies are effective

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run the test migration**: Execute `20250701000003_test_service_permissions.sql` to verify all permissions work correctly.

2. **Test application functionality**:
   - User authentication and organization access
   - Conversation creation and messaging
   - Payment processing
   - Admin operations

3. **Security testing**:
   - Attempt cross-organization data access
   - Verify payment records cannot be modified
   - Test role-based restrictions

## Deployment Steps

1. Review all three migration files
2. Run migrations in order:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
3. Run the test migration to verify permissions
4. Test application functionality thoroughly
5. Monitor for any permission-related errors

## Performance Considerations

Added indexes to support RLS policy performance:

- `idx_org_members_user_status`: Speeds up active member lookups
- `idx_conversations_org_id`: Improves conversation filtering
- `idx_messages_conversation_org`: Optimizes message queries

## Ongoing Security Recommendations

1. **Regular audits**: Review RLS policies quarterly
2. **Monitor audit logs**: Check for unusual access patterns
3. **Update policies**: As new features are added, ensure proper RLS
4. **Test migrations**: Always include permission tests in new migrations
5. **Document changes**: Keep this security model documented

## Conclusion

The implemented changes significantly improve the security posture of the Campfire application by:

- Enforcing strict data isolation between organizations
- Implementing principle of least privilege
- Adding comprehensive audit trails
- Providing helper functions for consistent access control

These changes ensure that even if the service account is compromised, the damage is limited by the restricted permissions and validation requirements.
